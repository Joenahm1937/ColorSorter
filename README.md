# Color Sorter

This is a sorting visualizer that uses RGB values or size as the sorting conditions. RGB was chosen as the primary sorting criteria as it yields visually pleasing results, although noisy. Originally HSV values were used as the condition; however, with numerous trials, RGB yielded significantly better looking results for the sample range of 0-200 color bars.
